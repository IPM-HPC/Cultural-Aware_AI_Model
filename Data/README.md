# WikiArt Dataset

## Description:

- The WikiArt dataset is a comprehensive collection of artworks sourced from the WikiArt website. It contains high-quality images of paintings from a wide variety of artists and artistic movements, spanning different periods and styles.

# ArtElingo

## Description:

- ArtElingo is an extension of the Artemis dataset. Unlike Artemis, which provides textual descriptions for artworks in a single language (English), ArtElingo is a multilingual dataset. It offers captions for artworks in multiple languages (Arabic, Chineese, and English), making it valuable for tasks that require a combination of image and text data, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and multimodal learning.
